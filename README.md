Overlay fix for La Reunion in X-Plane 11

## Why?
The default overlay/autogen in X-Plane 11 for Reunion Island (La Réunion) is totally messed up (at least for forest). See picture below.

*(near Saint Denis Gillot airport (FMEE), ZL19 with Ortho4Xp, tiles from FRorth provider)*

## How?
I'm new to X-Plane and scenery editing. I'm currently using [WED](http://developer.x-plane.com/tools/worldeditor/) to apply exclusions. It's a long and tedious process but I don't know if there is faster/smarter way.
