Overlay fix for La Reunion in X-Plane 11

## Why?
The default overlay/autogen in X-Plane 11 for Reunion Island (La RÃ©union) is totally messed up (at least for forest). See picture below.

## How?
I'm new to X-Plane and scenery editing. I'm currently using [WED](http://developer.x-plane.com/tools/worldeditor/) to apply exclusions. It's a long and tedious process but I don't know if there is faster/smarter way.

It's just a first draw to see how things works. There are no details like small forest and so.

WIP!
